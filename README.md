Hello!
Title: Payment Gateway Integration for a Donation Website

I completed Task 3 of my Web Development and Designing Internship at The Sparks Foundation in April 2023. As part of the Undergraduate Rotational Internship Program, I built a fully responsive donation website with payment integration using RazorPay payment gateway. The website supports payments through credit/debit card, UPI, wallet, and net banking. Additionally, the payment gateway sends an email and a receipt to the recipient's email ID.

Technologies used for this project include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, while Visual Studio Code was the software used for development. I am happy to share that the project is available on Github (https://rb.gy/5fsbl
) and can be accessed on the website (https://rb.gy/nk6zu
). I have also created a video demonstration of the project, which can be viewed on YouTube (https://rb.gy/hjmuv
).

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
